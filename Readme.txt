“The Bus Ticket System”

This project is a C++ code written in DEV C++ IDE using the basics concepts of OOPs. Through this code the user can get the bus ticket invoice or the travel tickets history by selecting appropriate option and providing the following information:
1. Route of travel
2. Source of travel from the selected route
3. Destination of travel from the selected route
4. Choose the type of bus for travel i.e Normal or AC.
5. Number of passengers.
There is a Tickets.CSV file, linked to the code which stores all the ticket data and the history of the tickets is maintained through this file. The code will be easy to understand as it uses the basic concepts and commenting is done in the whole code wherever it was necessary and required. 
The cost is mainly calculated on basis of the distance between the source and the destination stoppage & the type of bus chosen as there are two types of buses, AC and Non-AC. Currently this code provides the bus tickets for the four routes mentioned below with standard and most common bus stops available :
A. Hoshiarpur to Chandigarh
B. Chandigarh to Hoshiarpur
C. Patiala to Chandigarh
D. Chandigarh to Patiala
